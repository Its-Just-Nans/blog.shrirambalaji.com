I've been using [hashnode.dev](https://hashnode.dev) for the last couple of years as my primary blogging platform. It served well for the last couple of years, but I think it's time for a change.

## Why I'm moving away from hashnode

Don't get me wrong, hashnode is great to get started and helps build a habit of writing. But over time I've realized that I don't really write a lot, but when I do - I want it to look the way I want.

### Custom CSS is difficult to main

Hashnode had custom CSS for a couple of years, and I've raved about in the past.

<div class="tweet-embed">
	<Tweet id="https://twitter.com/shrirambalaji/status/1341662028843241474" />
</div>

But over time, as with custom stylesheets - _things broke_. The theming was inconsistent with my site at [shrirambalaji.com](https://shrirambalaji.com) and it was hard to maintain. In hindsight, I should have realized that adding custom stylesheets without having any form of guarantee of it not breaking, would eventually turn out to be an issue. I did spend a couple days to get it to match the theme, but that's mainly because I couldn't find extensive theming options on hashnode, and felt it to be limiting. (whether or not I write often - atleast the site should look consistent ðŸ˜…)

Another slightly tangential issue was with code highlighting. I didn't particularly like the highlighting theme, and also the code theme didn't switch when going from Dark to Light.

Apart from these, there were some interesting things I wanted to try:

- I've started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my primary way to write down notes. With iCloud and Git sync, its much easier for me to take my notes everywhere and I wanted to experiment with this for blogging.
- I've tried Astro for some projects, but wanted to try it out since their 3.0 release. [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) also seemed like a very cool way to manage content.

## The Process

- Export documents from hashnode
- Setup Astro, (preferably use a starter)
- Update theming, setup syntax highlighting (shiki) with support for theme switching
- Setup Obsidian-Git Sync

## Exporting Documents from Hashnode

I originally expected exports to be markdown files, but to my surprise it was a json dump of all my articles. Fortunately, hashnode has a neat Github Backup integration that backed up all my articles as markdown files. Neat!

Since they were all backed up, it was just a matter of cloning them from the repo.

## Setting up Astro

Since I wanted to move over things quickly and not spend a lot of time crafting the block, I wanted to find an astro starter / theme.

After searching a bit, on [Astro's Theme Search](https://astro.build/themes/?search=&categories%5B%5D=blog) I found an opinionated starter that I liked - [Astro Theme Cactus by Chris Williams](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus)
