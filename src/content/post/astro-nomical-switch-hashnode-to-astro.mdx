I've been using [hashnode.dev](https://hashnode.dev) for the last couple of years as my primary blogging platform. It served well for the last couple of years, but I think it's time for a change.

## Why I'm moving away from hashnode

Don't get me wrong, hashnode is great to get started and helps build a habit of writing. But over time I've realized that I don't really write a lot, but when I do - I want it to look the way I want.

### Custom CSS is difficult to main

Hashnode had custom CSS for a couple of years, and I've raved about in the past.

<div class="tweet-embed">
	<Tweet id="https://twitter.com/shrirambalaji/status/1341662028843241474" />
</div>

But over time, as with custom stylesheets - _things broke_. The theming was inconsistent with my site at [shrirambalaji.com](https://shrirambalaji.com) and it was hard to maintain. In hindsight, I should have realized that adding custom stylesheets without having any form of guarantee of it not breaking, would eventually turn out to be an issue. I did spend a couple days to get it to match the theme, but that's mainly because I couldn't find extensive theming options on hashnode, and felt it to be limiting. (whether or not I write often - atleast the site should look consistent ðŸ˜…)

Another slightly tangential issue was with code highlighting. I didn't particularly like the highlighting theme, and also the code theme didn't switch when going from Dark to Light.

Apart from these, there were some interesting things I wanted to try:

- I've started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as my primary way to write down notes. I wanted to experiment with this for publishing blogs from anywhere.
- I've tried Astro for some projects, but wanted to try it out since their 3.0 release. [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) also seemed like a very cool way to manage content.

## The Process

- Export documents from hashnode
- Setup Astro, (preferably use a starter)
- Update theming, setup syntax highlighting (shiki) with support for theme switching
- Setup Obsidian-Git Sync

## Exporting Documents from Hashnode

I originally expected exports to be markdown files, but to my surprise it was a json dump of all my articles. Fortunately, hashnode has a neat Github Backup integration that backed up all my articles as markdown files. Neat!

Since they were all backed up, it was just a matter of cloning them from the repo.

## Setting up Astro

Since I wanted to move over things quickly and not spend a lot of time crafting the block, I wanted to find an astro starter / theme.

After searching a bit, on [Astro's Theme Search](https://astro.build/themes/?search=&categories%5B%5D=blog) I found an opinionated starter that I liked - [Astro Theme Cactus by Chris Williams](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus)

### Features

The feature list was exactly what I was looking for, and also supported **View Transitions** âœ¨

- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)Â static search library integration
- [Astro Icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon)Â svg icon component

### Theming and Code Highlighting

Since my portfolio was also on tailwind, it was pretty straightforward to port the themes to this site. I just had to update a couple of `css-variables` and replace the fonts to use `Inter` (probably the best font ever, thanks [@rsms](https://twitter.com/rsms)) and it was done. I still had to make some more stylistic changes to how tags looked like in the default starter, but the starter was pretty good out of the box.

For code highlighting however, the default Astro + Shiki configuration didn't allow me to switch themes. This is because Shiki generates themes at build time, client-side theme switching support is not built in. Shiki supports adding CSS Variables that allow to customize tokens in a theme individiually, and then changing those variables for light & dark theme.

#### Shikiji to the rescue

[Shikiji](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji), a pure ESM focused rewrite of Shiki has native support for dark-light mode theme switching. [Nate Moore](https://twitter.com/n_moore) who co-created astro suggested using this as an alternative to using CSS variables with Astro + Shiki in their discord community. Thanks Nate!

```bash
$ pnpm add rehype-shikiji
```

We need to disable the astro's in-built `shiki` syntax highlighting by setting it to `false`, and configure `rehype-shikiji` as a plugin in `astro.config.mjs`.

```js
export default defineConfig({
	markdown: {
		syntaxHighlight: false,
		rehypePlugins: [
			[
				shikiji,
				{
					themes: {
						light: "github-light",
						dark: "github-dark",
					},
				},
			],
		],
	})
```

Voila! We have beautiful syntax highlighting that switches between dark & light.

### Publishing Blogs from Anywhere with Obsidian

I wanted to write blog drafts from anywhere, and possibly turn this site into a digital garden of some sort when I have enough time. Obsidian has been amazing, and having come from Notion it was super nice. I loved the software, been using it for a couple of years and as someone who never used to take notes - Obsidian has helped build a habit.

#### [Obsidian-Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)

This obsidian plugin has a bunch of cool git features that allows it to auto backup, sync, pull, push, fetch repositories inside of obsidian, and treat a repository as a vault.

For setting it up on the web, I followed this article [Fleeting Notes - Obsidian Git Setup](https://linked-blog-starter.vercel.app/connect-obsidian-vault-with-github). This was pretty straightforward to do, and I was able to set it up pretty quickly.

On mobile, I had some hiccups but the [Obsidian Git - Mobile Docs](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Getting+Started#Clone+via+plugin) was pretty descriptive. I wanted to have only the `content` directory of this site, in n obsidian vault but that seemed impossible with this plugin, so I just resorted to using the entire site as an obsidian vault.

As a workaround,I tried the [`File Hider`](https://github.com/Oliver-Akins/file-hider) plugin to hide the rest of the `src` folder and now the setup was ready. I wanted to write [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com/) to use Astro components,
