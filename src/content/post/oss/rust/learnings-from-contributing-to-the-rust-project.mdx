I've been reading about Rust compilation stages, and wrote about some of my learnings in a [previous post](https://blog.shrirambalaji.com/posts/resolving-rust-symbols/). As I started reading more, I realized that it might be helpful to find a way to contribute to the project, learn more about the compiler and validate my assumptions / understanding of the compiler.

## Finding an issue to work on

The `rustc` compiler is a large codebase, and I was a bit intimidated by the size of the codebase. I started looking at the issues that were tagged as `E-mentor` and found an issue that was tagged as `E-mentor` and `E-easy` and landed on [#129599](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/129599).

It involved adding a new `std_features` flag to the bootstrap phase of the compiler, that helps in enabling `std` features for compiler development. This could be features like enabling `panic-unwind` or `backtrace` features when building the compiler.

This felt like a good issue to start with, and it was relatively straightforward to understand the issue, but I had to understand how the compiler was bootstrapped and how the `std_features` flag was passed to the compiler.

I also connected with [`Onur Ozkan`](https://onurozkan.dev) who was the mentor for the issue on zulip chat, and he was very helpful and welcoming throughout the process. Thanks Onur!

## What's bootstrapping?

Bootstrapping is how the compiler compiles itself, typically by using an older version to build a newer version. For rust to bootstrap, it has 4 stages:

- Stage 0: Pre-compiled Compiler - the current beta `rustc` and is downloaded from the internet.
- Stage 1: Compiler built with the pre-compiled compiler from Stage 0
- Stage 2: Rebuilding the stage 1 compiler with itself, and this is what get's distributed with `rustup`.
- Stage 3 (optional): We can build libs with this compiler to sanity check that the compiler result is the same as the stage 2 compiler.

The [Rustc Dev Guide on Bootstrapping](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/bootstrapping/what-bootstrapping-does.html) has a lot more details on bootstrapping, if you're interested in learning more.

## Getting started

I followed the steps in the [Quick Start](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#quick-start) guide on my macOs machine, and I ran into my first issue.

### Lesson: Don't install `binutils` via `brew`

The `./x.py setup` command failed with the following error:

```

It looked like the build failed because the dependencies couldn't be compiled. Initially I thought that I had some system dependencies missing, but later found out that it was because of conflicting system dependencies. Specifically, I had `binutils` installed via `brew` and I had `strip` in my path, which was conflicting with the `strip` that was being used by the compiler.

So I had to remove `binutils` from my path, and then the build was successful:

```shell
brew uninstall binutils
```

### What's that python script doing in my rust compiler?

Wait a minute - why's there a python script to build the compiler? ðŸ¤”

`x.py` a wrapper that calls into `bootstrap` which is a cross-platform build tool backed by `cargo` specifically for the rust project. `x.py` by itself doesn't do a lot more, other than checking for the python version and subsequently invoking the `bootstrap.py` script, which does the following:

- Parses the CLI arguments and passes it on the `bootstrap` tool
- Downloads the rust toolchain, and makes sure that the necessary build tools `rustc`, `cargo` etc., are available.
- Runs the bootstrap build using `cargo` to compile the bootstrap tool in `src/bootstrap`. The CLI arguments from earlier are passed to the `bootstrap` tool.
- Finally, the `bootstrap` tool is run with the CLI arguments.

So when we call `./x <subcommand>`, it's actually invoking the `bootstrap` CLI with the subcommand.

:::note
I understand the convenience of having a python script to wrap the build process, but it was a bit surprising to look at first. Also it does seem like Python is preferred for build scripts that run in CI, and it's not overused. There's a discussion to purge python, and over time it seems like a lot of the python scripts have been replaced. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/110479

## Setting up Zed for Compiler Development

I've started using Zed for all of my personal work, and it's been fantastic.

<div class="tweet-embed">
	<Tweet id="1847665535502213165" />
</div>

`./x setup` has an option to add settings for VSCode, but none for Zed. Specifically, this is important for `rust_analyzer` to work correctly during rust compiler dev. The configuration for `rust_analyzer` is not very different from VSCode, but needs to be added in a `.zed/settings.json` in the root of the repo:

```json title=".zed/settings.json"
{
	"lsp": {
		"rust-analyzer": {
			"initialization_options": {
				"check": {
					"invocationLocation": "root",
					"invocationStrategy": "once",
					"overrideCommand": ["python3", "x.py", "check", "--json-output"]
				},
				"linkedProjects": [
					"Cargo.toml",
					"src/tools/x/Cargo.toml",
					"src/bootstrap/Cargo.toml",
					"src/tools/rust-analyzer/Cargo.toml",
					"compiler/rustc_codegen_cranelift/Cargo.toml",
					"compiler/rustc_codegen_gcc/Cargo.toml"
				],
				"rustfmt": {
					"overrideCommand": ["./build/host/rustfmt/bin/rustfmt", "--edition=2021"]
				},
				"procMacro": {
					"enable": true,
					"server": "./build/host/stage0/libexec/rust-analyzer-proc-macro-srv"
				},
				"cargo": {
					"buildScripts": {
						"enable": true,
						"invocationLocation": "root",
						"invocationStrategy": "once",
						"overrideCommand": ["python3", "x.py", "check", "--json-output"]
					},
					"sysrootSrc": "./library",
					"extraEnv": {
						"RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP": "1"
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

There's an open issue to add a step for setting Zed for compiler dev, and I just assigned it to myself to get it fixed: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/126931

## Making the change

The change involved a couple of steps:

- Adding a new field `std_features` in the `config.toml` file
- Parsing (deduplicated) and updating the internal rust `features` config to be passed on the compiler bootstrap process
- Unit tests

```toml title="config.toml"
[rust]
# other options for compiling rust . . .
std-features = ["panic_unwind"]
```

### The internal toml parser

The internal `toml` parser, parses the `config.toml` and all its sections and fields in predefined [`structs`](https://github.com/shrirambalaji/rust/blob/8b968764f15ea84b389b2af98297b9d30fb9952e/src/bootstrap/src/core/config/config.rs#L1101) from the config file, so I just had to add a field in the `Rust` struct, mapping it to the field name [here](https://github.com/shrirambalaji/rust/blob/8b968764f15ea84b389b2af98297b9d30fb9952e/src/bootstrap/src/core/config/config.rs#L1156).

For deduplicating, I originally used a `HashSet` on the list of values, but was recommended a `BTreeSet` to get deterministic ordering - which made sense, and should've been my first choice.

### Error Handling

The `toml` parser handles parsing errors by default, so I didn't have to do anything there. Since the `std_features` option can fundamentally change the output of the compiler, we should throw an error if this configuration is passed in CI builds. I really liked the `err` macro that they had setup for making this easy.

```rust
macro_rules! err {
  ($current:expr, $expected:expr) => {
      if let Some(current) = &$current {
          if Some(current) != $expected.as_ref() {
              return Err(format!(
                  "ERROR: Setting `llvm.{}` is incompatible with `llvm.download-ci-llvm`. \
                  Current value: {:?}, Expected value(s): {}{:?}",
                  stringify!($expected).replace("_", "-"),
                  $current,
                  if $expected.is_some() { "None/" } else { "" },
                  $expected,
              ));
          };
      };
  };
}
```

I usually stay away from macros (skill issue tbh), I liked this one. However, this could have very well been a function too if you ask me.

### Merging the change - Squashing commits

I addressed all the feedback comments, and the PR was ready for merge. But `rustc` compiler development follows rebase + squash for contributors. I generally have my own reservations about rebase:

<div class="tweet-embed">
	<Tweet id="1769207470814269687" />
</div>

I learnt that most of my pain with rebase was mostly due to my ignorance of [`rerere`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rerere) which solves a lot of issues dealing with rebase merge conflicts in the past.

Rebasing by itself wasn't tricky, but I'm not generally used to squashing, so this was new. The first time around I botched the squash and messed up the branch. Since it was also a rebase and I pushed upstream, there was no way to undo it (maybe there's one, but I gave up pretty quickly).

So I made a new branch, rebased upstream onto it and cherry-picked my changes from the previous changes, and then squashed all of them into a single commit after following through this [article](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash).

Finally, after a couple of weeks of picking up my first issue, I got my first PR merged - https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/131315. This might all sound trivial, but hey - I would not have imagined me being able to contribute something to the rust project a couple of years ago, it's good to count the small wins! https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.83.0/ now lists me as a contributor ðŸ˜„

Looking forward to contributing and learning a lot more about `rustc`.

See you in the next one ðŸ‘‹
