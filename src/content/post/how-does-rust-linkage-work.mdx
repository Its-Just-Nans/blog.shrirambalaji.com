Goals
- Basics of Linking in Unix systems
- Ld basics (mention mold)
- Rust compilation viz, linking static vs dynamic
- Demo
- Dive deeper
- Part II follow up for Windows

# Understanding Linking

"Programmers tend to build their programs on top of libraries of reusable code — for example, libc, which we talked about earlier. When turning your source code into an executable binary, a program called a linker resolves all these references by finding the library code and copying it into the binary. This process is called _static linking_, which means external code is included directly in the file that’s distributed."

# Executable Linkers are basically just home theater setups
