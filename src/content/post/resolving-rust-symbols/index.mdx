Linking is the process of combining object files into an executable or shared library. It's like putting together puzzle pieces to create a working program. The magic happens during symbol resolution, where the linker matches variable and function names (ie. symbols) to their specific memory addresses, making sure everything fits together.


## Phases of Compilation

In compiled languages like C, C++, or Rust, a build step consists of two phases. In the first phase, a compiler compiles source files into object files (`.o` files). In the second phase, a linker takes all object files and combines them into a single executable or shared library file. Let's try to understand linking in the context of Rust.

## What does a Linker do?

- Resolves symbols in object files
- Combines object files into a single executable or shared library
- Resolves dependencies between object files
- Generates a symbol table for the final executable

### Linking in Unix-like Systems

In Unix-like systems, the linker is typically `ld` (linker and loader). The linker is responsible for resolving symbols in object files and generating the final executable or shared library.

To understand this from a rust perspective, let's setup a simple rust project. I'll be switching back and forth between Linux and macOS, to compare and contrast things.

For the Linux VM, I'm using [orbstack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/architecture#:~:text=OrbStack%20uses%20a%20lightweight%20Linux,integration%20with%20macOS%2C%20and%20more.) to create a "machine" on macOS which work like traditional vms, but shares the same kernel.

After setting up rust in the vm using [rustup](https://rustup.rs), we use cargo to create a new rust project.

```bash
$ cargo new learning-linkers
```

Let's try to build it.

```shell
$ cd learning-linkers && cargo build
Compiling learning-linkers v0.1.0 (/Users/shrirambalaji/Repositories/learning-linkers)
error: linker `cc` not found
  |
  = note: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

Hmm, an error. We run into a ``linker `cc` not found error`` because the rust installer assumes that a C linker is already present, instead of checking for the necessary compiler toolchain.

On linux machines, the de-facto toolchain is `gcc`(GNU Compiler Collection) which seems to be missing. The default linker `ld` is part of `gcc` and hence needs to be installed (the first time). The `build-essential` meta package has `gcc` and a couple other packages:

```shell
$ sudo apt install build-essential
```

> NOTE: On macOS, the new default linker is `ld-prime` (since XCode 15) which is part of the Xcode command line tools. You can install it by running `xcode-select --install`.

We can also choose a different linker like [`lld`](https://lld.llvm.org)which is LLVM's linker or [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold). [LLVM](https://llvm.org)is another compiler toolchain like gcc, but aims to be modular. Mold is a more recent alternative and is several times quicker based on their benchmarks, especially on Linux.

We'll come across LLVM again, because `rustc` relies heavily on LLVM during different stages of compilation. 

## Rust Compilation Pipeline

To understand linking, it's crucial to understand the rust compilation pipeline which involves a series of steps, from source code -> executable.

### Lexing and parsing

<ThemedImage
	alt="Rust Compilation - Lexing & Parsing Phase"
	src={"/public/attachments/rust-compilation-lexing-parsing.svg"}
	darkSrc={"/public/attachments/rust-compilation-lexing-parsing-dark.svg"}
  borderDashed
></ThemedImage>

The source code is analyzed by a [lexer (`rustc_lexer`)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lexer/index.html) and converted into a stream of [tokens](). Then, the [parser (`rustc_parse`)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/index.html) takes in the stream of tokens and converts it into an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST).

### HIR & MIR

The AST from the previous step is converted into a HIR (High-level Intermediate Representation), which is a friendlier representation to work with. During this step the compiler does the following:

- Performs macro expansion
- Desugars syntactic sugar
- [Type inference](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/type-inference.html) ie. automatically deducing the types of variables and expressions
- [Trait Solving](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/traits/resolution.html) → Finding the correct implementation of a trait for a type
- [Type Checking](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/type-checking.html) → Converting HIR types (hir::Ty) to Rustc's internal types (ty::Ty)

The process of converting AST to HIR is called **lowering**. Then, the HIR is further lowered into an MIR (Middle-level Intermediate Representation), which is a more low-level representation. During this transformation, the compiler performs optimizations and does Monomorphization.

Monomorphization is the fancy term for generating specialized code for each type that a generic function is called with. This helps reduce the overhead of generics in Rust, and that's why Rust is often referred to as a "zero-cost abstractions" language. But hey, let's not forget, there's no such thing as a **free lunch**. The cost is _probably_ paid during compilation.

### Code Generation & Building the executable

<ThemedImage

	src={"/public/attachments/rust-compilation-building-executable.svg"}
	darkSrc={"/public/attachments/rust-compilation-building-executable-dark.svg"}
  borderDashed
></ThemedImage>


The MIR is then converted into LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation)is used by the LLVM toolchain. We will come back to LLVM IR, because it's pretty interesting.

The LLVM-IR is passed to LLVM, which does a bunch of fancy optimizations on it, spitting out machine code that's basically assembly code with some extra low-level types and annotations (like an ELF object or WASM). Then, all the different libraries and binaries are linked together to create the final binary.

whew, that was a lot of information. Let's get back to linking.

## Building the output - The `.o` object file

Rust is a systems language, so obviously our expectation is to be similar to C - right? Just let me compile and give me an object file that I can link to later? That's called [dynamic linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker) and that's the default of how things work with C, C++.

By default, Rust prefers the opposite - called [static linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library) wherein it will link in all Rust and native dependencies, producing a single distributable binary.

> NOTE: A [_crate_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/crates-and-source-files.html) is a unit of compilation and linking, as well as versioning, distribution, and runtime loading. A crate contains a *tree* of nested [module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html) scopes.

In Rust, the default crate-type is `bin` for binaries and `lib` for libraries. The `bin` crate type is used for creating executables, and the `lib` crate type is used for creating libraries. The `crate-type` attribute in the `Cargo.toml` file can be used to specify the crate type or it can be specified using the `--crate-type` flag.

I mentioned that rust prefers static linking, but obviously it doesn't mean that there are no `.o` files. However, it's not as straightforward as C. This is what's different:
- `rustc` (invoked internally by `cargo`) compiles rust source code into an executable or a library (`.rlib`), rather than separately compiling to an object file and then linking them ie. it tries to do both the phases (compilation and linking) we discussed earlier in one step.
- `rustc` views a crate as the basic unit of compilation, not files. hence, it typically compiles an entire crate at once.

In case of the `bin` crate the `.o` files are present inside the `/target/debug/incremental/*` directories when we run `cargo build`. These object files are particularly difficult to visualize, because they are part of rust's incremental compilation ie. it compiles parts of a crate / project that have changed since the previous build. These are typically managed by `rustc` and `cargo` internally, so we need to find a way to get the `.o` files ourselves.

## What's inside the `.o` file?

We can use the `--emit=obj` file to instruct `rustc` to emit object files. Let's understand this with an example, we have two files `foo.rs` and `bar.rs` which we will try to compile and link manually. The functionality is simple - we have a global variable `Global` which is modified by two functions `foo` and `bar`.

```rs title="foo.rs" "#![no_main]" {9-11}
#![no_main]

#[no_mangle]
pub static mut Global: i32 = 5;


#[no_mangle]
pub fn foo() {
  unsafe {
    Global = 10;
  }
}
```

The `#![no_main]` attribute is straightforward, it tells the compiler that there is no `main` function, and effectively not to throw a compiler error when it doesn't find one. If we have a `main` function, the `.o` file will contain a symbol for the `main` function and all of its linked dependencies. We want to avoid that for now so that visualizing the symbol table is easier.

The [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html) block tells the compiler that whatever is inside it puts the onus on the programmer to ensure memory safety. In this case, we are modifying a global variable from two different functions, which is _not safe_ in Rust. 

### The `#[no_mangle]` attribute

```rs title="what's mangling?" "#[no_mangle]"
#[no_mangle]
pub static mut Global: i32 = 5;
```

When Rust code is compiled, identifiers are “mangled” ie. transformed into a different name to include additional information. 

For example, with mangling enabled (ie. by default) the above foo `Global` variable gets mangled to `__ZN11foo6Global17ha2a12041c4e557c5E`. This is done to avoid naming conflicts when linking with other libraries, however we disable it with `#[no_mangle]` so that the symbol name is preserved, and can be easily linked by name.

Here's, `bar.rs`:

```rs title="bar.rs" {4-6}
#![no_main]

#[no_mangle]
extern "C" { 
    static mut Global: i32; 
    fn foo(); 
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn bar() {
    unsafe {
        Global = 20;
    }
}
```

The `extern "C"` block tells the compiler that the function or variable is defined elsewhere. You may wonder why it's `extern C`, and that's because this doesn't mean we are inter-operating with C, but rather the ABI (Application Binary Interface) that the function or variable uses. In this case, it's the C ABI. (Rust has its own ABI, but AFAIK it's not stable.)

Now, let's compile these files to object files. 

> NOTE: This, isn't how you would typically compile a rust program, and it is recommened to use `cargo`. We are doing this just to understand linking better.

```bash
$ rustc --emit=obj -o foo.o foo.rs
$ rustc --emit=obj -o bar.o bar.rs
```

### Symbols - A Deep Dive

We mentioned earlier what symbols are, but let's take a deeper look. Symbols (for eg. function names, variables) are stored in sections of the object file in a specific format - ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) on Unix-like systems. On macOS, it's Mach-O (Mach Object) but its similar to ELF.

This is how the sections are typically organized in an ELF object file:

<ThemedImage
	alt="ELF Sections in an Object File"
	src={"/public/attachments/elf-sections.svg"}
	darkSrc={"/public/attachments/elf-sections-dark.svg"}
></ThemedImage>

<p style={{ fontSize: "0.75em !important", marginTop: '-40px', marginLeft: '25px'}}>source: [CS 361 Systems Programming by Chris Kanich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XVUIeAaROU&list=PLhy9gU5W1fvUND_5mdpbNVHC1WCIaABbP&index=10)</p>

Apart from these sections, there are pseudo sections like "Common" and "Undefined", which we'll come across later. 

Alright, let's take a peek into the object file, specifically the symbol table. [Symbol table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20symbol,or%20appearance%20in%20the%20source.) is a data structure that contains a list of symbols and their addresses.

In Linux, we can use the `readelf` utility which can read the elf file (duh!), and outputs the sections in the object file. For viewing the symbol tables on linux, we can run:

```bash
$ readelf -sW foo.o

Symbol table '.symtab' contains 9 entries:
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
     0: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND
     1: 0000000000000000     0 FILE    LOCAL  DEFAULT  ABS foo.a147f3978a9294fa-cgu.0
     2: 0000000000000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    3 .text.foo
     3: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    3 $x.0
     4: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    5 $d.1
     5: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    6 $d.2
     6: 0000000000000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT    8 $d.3
     7: 0000000000000000    20 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    3 foo
     8: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    5 Global
```

> For some reason, when I use the Linux VM to visualize the symbol tables, the addresses are always `0000000000000000`. I'm not sure why this is the case, but I'll try to figure it out. I'll update this section once I figure it out.

From the output, we can infer:
* Global Symbols:
	- `foo`: A global function of size 20 bytes, defined in section `.text.foo` (index 7).
	- `Global`: A global object named `Global` of size 4 bytes since it's an `i32` (index 8).
* Local Symbols:
	- Several local symbols (e.g., $x.0, $d.1, $d.2, $d.3) without specific types, which are typically used for internal purposes by the compiler.
* File Symbol:
	- `foo.a147f3978a9294fa-cgu.0`: Represents the object file itself.
* Section Symbol:
	- `.text.foo`: Represents a text section specifically for the foo function.

However, `readelf` is not available on macOS, so we have to use the `nm` command to list the symbols in the object file. The `nm` command is a simpler utility that displays just the symbol table of an object file.

```bash
$ nm foo.o
0000000000000010 D _Global
0000000000000000 T _foo
0000000000000000 t ltmp0
0000000000000010 d ltmp1
0000000000000018 s ltmp2
```

The output of `nm` is in the following format:
- `D` - Global Data section symbol
- `T` - Global Text symbol
- `d` - Local symbol in the data section
- `s` - Unitialized Local symbol for small objects

If you haven't noticed, lowercase denotes local symbols, and uppercase denotes global symbols. The `ltmp` symbols are temporary symbols generated by the compiler during compilation.

Let's take a look at the symbol table for `bar.o` as well:

```bash
$ nm bar.o
                 U _Global
0000000000000000 T _bar
0000000000000000 t ltmp0
0000000000000018 N ltmp1
```

wherein `U` denotes an Undefined symbol. Remember, the Undefined pseudo section I was mentioning, that's where the `Global` symbol exists. This is because there's an _undefined_ symbol reference to the `Global` variable, which will be resolved only during the linking phase.

### Rules for Symbol Resolution

In the context of linking, there are two types of symbols:
* Strong Symbol: Defined directly in the object file, like `foo` in `foo.o`.
* Weak Symbol: Referenced but not defined, such as `Global` in `bar.o`.

Resolution rules:
* Simple: The linker prioritizes strong symbols over weak ones. Duplicate strong symbols cause errors, while duplicate weak symbols lead to the first encountered being used.
* Complex: For strong symbols with the same name but differing attributes (e.g., array sizes), the linker chooses the most fitting one but issues a warning.

Okay, enough about symbols. Let's move on to linking.

## Linking everything together

Until now, we don't have a `main.rs` file, so let's create one that calls the `foo` and `bar` functions.

```rust
// main.rs
extern "C" {
    fn foo();
    fn bar();
    static mut Global: i32;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        foo();
        bar();
        println!("Global: {}", Global);
    }
}
```

Let's compile the `main.rs` file to an object file.

```rs
$ rustc --emit=obj -o main.o main.rs
```

Now, we have three object files - `foo.o`, `bar.o`, and `main.o`. We can try to link them together using the `ld` command.

```bash
$ ld -o main main.o foo.o bar.o
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
  "__Unwind_Resume", referenced from:
      __ZN4core3ops8function6FnOnce9call_once17h8d9269e11286ae65E in main.o

  "dyld_stub_binder", referenced from:

ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
```

Oops, a linker error! From the mangled error message, it looks like a symbol reference to `core::ops::FnOnce::call_once` is undefined. We need to link the `core` crate to resolve this error. But, we can't just link the `core` crate, because it's not a `.o` file, but a `.rlib` file. As far as I know, there's no way to directly link a `.rlib` file with `ld` nor is it straightforward to link it with `rustc`.

There's an alternative way: adding the `[no_std]` attribute in `main.rs`, which instructs the compiler not to link the `std` crate. This is useful when we want to create a freestanding binary without the `std` library, for eg. when you are creating an OS. We would also need to implement the `eh_personality` language item, and implement our own panic handler. I don't think this is necessary to understand linking and I don't want to forego my precious `std` lib, so let's try a different approach.

## `staticlib` to the rescue

> `--crate-type=staticlib, #![crate_type = "staticlib"]` -  The purpose of this output type is to create a static library containing all of the local crate's code along with all upstream dependencies - [Linkage](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html)

Instead of us trying to link the `core` crate and bring in `std` dependencies ourselves, we can create a static library from the `foo.rs` and `bar.rs` files, and then link them manually:

```bash
# create a directory to store the output
$ mkdir -p target/out
$ rustc --crate-type=staticlib -o target/out/libfoo.a foo.rs
$ rustc --crate-type=staticlib -o target/out/libbar.a bar.rs
```

> The output is a `.a` file, which is a static library / archive in *nix systems. 

The archive `.a` file contains the `.o` files we saw above (along with other obj files required for the program), and we can take a quick peek. We use the `ar` command to list the contents of the archive.

```bash
$ ar -t target/out/libfoo.a | grep foo
foo.foo.730f9a7e513a85b2-cgu.0.rcgu.o
foo.10ftosr6tvdwscdu.rcgu.o
```

Interestingly the `.a` file contains the `.o` files we saw earlier, but with a different name, specifically with `*.rcgu.o` suffix. The `rcgu` stands for "Rust Codegen Unit" and is a unit of code that the compiler generates during [Code Generation](#code-generation--building-the-executable) phase.

If we extract the `.o` file and look, we can see the same symbols we saw earlier.

```bash
$ ar -x target/out/libfoo.a foo.foo.730f9a7e513a85b2-cgu.0.rcgu.o
$ nm foo.foo.730f9a7e513a85b2-cgu.0.rcgu.o 
0000000000000010 D _Global
0000000000000000 T _foo
0000000000000000 t ltmp0
0000000000000010 d ltmp1
0000000000000018 s ltmp2
```

## Using cargo to build the project

Up until now, we've been manually compiling and linking the files. But, we should ideally use `cargo`. Cargo is the build system and package manager for Rust. Additionaly, `cargo` lets us run a build script before building the project. The build script is a Rust file called `build.rs` that goes in the project's root.

```rust title="build.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-search=native=target/out");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=foo");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=bar");
}
```

* `cargo:rustc-link-search=native=target/out` instruction tells the compiler to search for the static libraries in the `target/out` directory
* `cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=foo` and `cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=bar` tells the compiler to link the `foo` and `bar` static libraries.

> NOTE: The link flag order _can be_ important. In this case, `bar` depends on the `Global` variable in `foo.rs`, so we link `foo` first and `bar` later. Traditional unix linkers go from left to right, and resolve symbols in the order they are specified. If there are no references to a symbol mentioned later, it will be discarded. AFAIK `ld` is "smart" enough to handle this, but it's good to be aware of this.

Now, we can compile the project with `cargo build` and it should link the static libraries. Actually, we can even add the previous `rustc` commands to run in the build script so that we can just run `cargo build` to compile the project instead of manually compiling `foo` and `bar`. The final build script looks like this:

```rust title="build.rs"
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    // rerun if foo.rs or bar.rs changes
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/foo.rs");
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=src/bar.rs");

    // creates the output directory in target/out
    std::fs::create_dir_all("target/out").unwrap();

    // Compile foo.rs and bar.rs into a static library
    Command::new("rustc")
        .args(&[
            "--crate-type=staticlib",
            "src/foo.rs",
            "-o",
            "target/out/libfoo.a",
        ])
        .status()
        .unwrap();

    Command::new("rustc")
        .args(&[
            "--crate-type=staticlib",
            "src/bar.rs",
            "-o",
            "target/out/libbar.a",
        ])
        .status()
        .unwrap();

    println!("cargo:rustc-link-search=native=target/out");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=foo");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=bar");
}
```

Let's build it:
```bash
$ cargo build
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
```

Yay! It compiled successfully, which means the linking was successful. We can run the binary with `cargo run` to see the output.

```bash
$ cargo run
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/learning-linkers`
Global: 20
```

The output `Global: 20` means that the `foo` and `bar` functions were called successfully and the `Global` variable was modified by both functions (`Global` was original set to 5).

## Conclusion

Writing this article was an immense learning for me, to try and understand linking in Rust, starting from the basics of linking in Unix-like systems, symbol resolution, what's inside an ELF format `.o` file, understanding the Rust compilation pipeline, and finally linking static Rust libraries manually.

I might have missed some details, or made some mistakes, so please feel free to correct me. I'm always open to learning new things. Thanks for reading! All the code samples, articles and videos I used for research are linked below in the #[References](#references) section. 

Until next time 👋
